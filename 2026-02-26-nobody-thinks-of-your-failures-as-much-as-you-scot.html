      <h2>Summary: "Nobody Thinks of Your Failures As Much as You" | Scott Galloway</h2>

<p>In this thought-provoking discussion, Scott Galloway explains why stoicism matters for mental and emotional health. Drawing from Ryan Holiday's teachings, he distills stoicism into a simple but powerful concept: life isn't about what happens to you, but how you respond to it. He uses the iconic line from *Brokeback Mountain* — "If you can't fix it, you got to stand it" — as a modern example of stoic philosophy. Galloway admits he struggles to practice what he preaches, making his message feel authentic and relatable.</p>

<p>Galloway shares a crucial insight about human nature: <strong>nobody thinks about your failures as much as you do</strong>. He explains that while we obsess over our mistakes, embarrassments, and perceived shortcomings, others are too busy worrying about themselves. This realization helped him stop sweating the small stuff and focus on what truly matters — his relationships with his spouse and children.</p>

<p>The conversation takes a critical turn toward social media, particularly Twitter. Galloway reveals he quit Twitter for nine months and calls it "one of the most beneficial things" for his mental health. He describes the addictive nature of these platforms and warns about how quickly they can lead vulnerable users (especially teenagers) down dangerous rabbit holes — from extreme dieting content to normalizing suicidal thoughts. He emphasizes that parents need to be far more aware of these risks.</p>

<p>Galloway also discusses deathbed regret research conducted by his NYU colleague Adam Alter. The findings are striking: people's biggest regret isn't career-related or financial — it's wishing they'd been less hard on themselves, had forgiven themselves, and allowed themselves to be happy. This profoundly shaped Galloway's approach to life.</p>
