      <h1>How Sports Betting Took Over Kalshi & Polymarket | My First Million</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this episode of *My First Million*, the hosts dive into the explosive growth of sports betting on prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket—highlighting a trend they describe as both massive and potentially problematic. They open by citing an Economist article revealing just how sophisticated sports betting companies have become: by the time a customer places their first bet, these platforms can predict with 80-90% certainty what kind of "sucker" that person will be. These companies mathematically monitor players every 6-8 hours, constantly calculating risk scores to determine whether to keep profitable players out and unprofitable ones in.</p>

<p>The hosts then explain how prediction markets differ fundamentally from traditional sports books. Unlike conventional betting where the house sets the odds, prediction markets operate as free markets where odds fluctuate based on the volume of money flowing into "yes" or "no" positions. This creates powerful incentives—unlike journalists who chase clicks, anyone betting on these platforms puts their own money on the line, making the markets remarkably accurate predictors of real-world events, often more so than traditional news sources.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most striking revelation is the scale of what's happening: these platforms are now processing over $2 billion per week in betting volume. Originally, prediction markets focused on elections, geopolitical events, and financial hedges—but sports betting has become so dominant that these platforms are essentially functioning as sports betting apps operating through a regulatory loophole. Because they're technically "prediction markets" rather than sports books, they remain legal in all 50 states, allowing them to bypass traditional gambling restrictions.</p>
