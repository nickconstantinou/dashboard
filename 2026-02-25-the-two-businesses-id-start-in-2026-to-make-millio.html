      <h1>The Two Businesses I'd Start in 2026 to Make Millions</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this video, the speaker addresses the question of what business opportunities they would pursue in 2026 if they were starting over. They emphasize that opportunities are highly situational—someone with elite education and family support has very different options than a single parent or someone without a college degree. The speaker criticizes "hustle culture" advice that ignores these real constraints.</p>

<p>For <strong>non-credentialed individuals</strong> (those without traditional four-year degrees from elite institutions), the speaker recommends acquiring small businesses from aging boomers. Industries like carpet cleaning, gas stations, drapery sales, and small furniture companies are ripe for takeover. These businesses generate $500,000 to $10 million annually but have no succession plan because the owners' children would rather work at Google than inherit the family business. The strategy is to approach these owners, offer to buy the business gradually over five years, and help them retire.</p>

<p>For <strong>credentialed individuals</strong>, the speaker suggests two paths. First, working at a large multinational corporation is vastly underrated—the top 10 companies by market cap have massively outperformed for decades, and these companies can create significant wealth through stock appreciation. Second, for entrepreneurs with capital and credentials, the intersection of <strong>AI and healthcare</strong> represents the biggest opportunity. The US healthcare system is a $3.5-4 trillion market with 80% customer dissatisfaction and costs that have outpaced inflation for 40 years. AI can transform healthcare from defensive to proactive, analyzing data like grocery receipts, workout routines, and sleep patterns to provide personalized recommendations.</p>

<p>The speaker backs up this conviction with a personal example: they're an investor in a company called 98.6, which offers text-based healthcare through employers. However, they honestly note the investment has lost 80% of its value—so they're not claiming this path is easy.</p>

<h2>Key Topics Discussed</h2>

<li>Situational entrepreneurship: opportunities depend on your credentials, support system, and financial obligations</li>
<li>Small business acquisition strategy: buying from aging boomer-owned businesses lacking succession plans</li>
<li>Working at big corporations as an undervalued wealth-building strategy</li>
<li>AI + healthcare as the most disruptible opportunity in the world</li>
<li>The scale and dysfunction of the US healthcare system</li>

<p>---</p>

<h2>Main Takeaways</h2>

<li><strong>Your starting point matters</strong> — don't follow generic hustle advice without considering your personal situation</li>
<li><strong>Small business acquisitions are overlooked</strong> — aging business owners need exits, and many don't have family successors willing to take over</li>
<li><strong>Big company careers aren't "selling out"</strong> — working at Google or similar giants has historically created enormous wealth through stock appreciation</li>
<li><strong>AI + healthcare is the massive opportunity</strong> — a $4 trillion market with widespread dissatisfaction, ripe for AI-powered disruption</li>
<li><strong>Not all investments pan out</strong> — even experienced investors lose money; the speaker's healthcare tech investment dropped 80%</li>
