      <h1>The Algebra of Wealth: Scott Galloway's Simple Formula</h1>

<p>In this video, Professor Scott Galloway presents his "algebra of wealth" formula: <strong>focus + stoicism × diversification = wealth</strong>. He breaks down this equation into actionable steps, starting with finding your talent and focusing on it during your 20s in an industry that will actually pay you. Galloway emphasizes that wealth isn't about how much you make—it's about how much you spend. The key is to develop what he calls a "savings muscle" early, getting to the point where you spend less than you make.</p>

<p>Galloway pulls no punches when discussing consumer culture, calling out companies that try to convince you that upgrading from economy to business class is "an investment in yourself." He bluntly states: "No, it's not. It's consumption." His advice is refreshingly practical—don't order $450 bottles of vodka, drive a Hyundai, travel coach, and save money. He notes that no one is as concerned with your possessions as you are, so stop trying to impress others.</p>

<p>The professor also emphasizes the critical importance of diversification. Once you have real capital, start spreading your investments immediately so that "no matter what happens, you have Kevlar." Even if a stock goes to zero, you won't be killed because you're diversified. He points out that the S&P 500 has returned 11% annually since 2008, meaning your investments double approximately every 7 years and grow 8x every 21 years.</p>

<p>Galloway explains that the first variable in his formula—focus—means being really great at one thing rather than spreading yourself thin with side hustles. He recommends finding an industry that isn't "sexy," noting that if you're in the top 10% of tax law, HVAC installation, or installing soapstone kitchen counters, you'll make a really good living. He also discusses his new book series, explaining that he uses formulas and constructs to help people remember important concepts.</p>

<h2>Main Takeaways</h2>
<li><strong>Spend less than you make.</strong> This is the foundation of building wealth—develop a savings muscle early and avoid trying to impress others with expensive purchases.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on one thing and become great at it.</strong> Wealth comes from mastery, not from having multiple side hustles. Find an industry (even unglamorous ones) where you can reach the top 10%.</li>
<li><strong>Diversify your investments.</strong> Once you have capital, spread it across investments so that any single failure won't devastate you.</li>
<li><strong>Time is your biggest asset when you're young.</strong> The S&P 500 averages 11% returns annually—compound interest works powerfully over time.</li>
<li><strong>Wealth building is a slow game.</strong> Galloway admits the bad news is that getting rich takes time and discipline, but the formula works if you stick with it.</li>
