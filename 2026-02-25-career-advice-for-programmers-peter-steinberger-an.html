      <h1>Career Advice for Programmers: Peter Steinberger & Lex Fridman</h1>

<p>In this conversation, Lex Fridman asks Peter Steinberger about the key metrics programmers should optimize for in their careers—whether it's happiness, money, or positive impact. Peter acknowledges that he achieved many of these things but eventually experienced burnout, leading him to reflect on what truly matters.</p>

<p>Peter shares his journey building PSPDFKit for 13 years, explaining that the burnout wasn't primarily from working too hard, but from the "people stuff"—conflicts with co-founders and high-stress situations with customers that eventually wore him down. He describes the moment he realized something was wrong: he sat in front of his screen and felt like Austin Powers with his "mojo sucked out," unable to code anymore and feeling empty.</p>

<p>After selling the company, Peter took a one-way trip to Madrid to "catch up on life." He emphasizes that simply retiring and enjoying life isn't as appealing as it sounds—when you wake up with nothing to look forward to and no real challenge, life becomes boring very fast. He warns that boredom can lead people to seek stimulation in unhealthy ways.</p>

<h2>Key Topics Discussed</h2>

<li>What success metric programmers should optimize for</li>
<li>Building and running a company for 13 years</li>
<li>Burnout and its true causes</li>
<li>The importance of having challenges and meaning in life</li>
<li>Recovery and finding balance</li>

<h2>Main Takeaways</h2>

<li><strong>Burnout often comes from people problems, not just long hours</strong> – Co-founder conflicts and high-stress customer situations can be more draining than the actual programming work.</li>
<li><strong>Work isn't everything, but neither is retirement</strong> – Having no challenges or nothing to look forward to leads to boredom and emptiness.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous learning and challenge are essential</strong> – Peter now enjoys life more than ever because he wakes up with things to anticipate.</li>
<li><strong>Make yourself obsolete in your role</strong> – Peter spent two years before leaving PSPDFKit training others to take over, allowing him to exit gracefully.</li>
<li><strong>Take time to "catch up on life"</strong> – Stepping away completely to recharge is necessary for long-term wellbeing.</li>

<h2>Who Would Benefit From Watching</h2>

<li>Programmers and developers at any career stage</li>
<li>Tech founders and startup entrepreneurs</li>
<li>Anyone experiencing burnout or questioning their career direction</li>
<li>People interested in work-life balance and long-term career sustainability in tech</li>
