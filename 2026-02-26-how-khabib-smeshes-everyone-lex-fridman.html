      <h1>How Khabib Smashes Everyone | Lex Fridman</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This video features a conversation about Khabib Nurmagomedov's legendary fighting style and training philosophy. The discussion centers on what makes Khabib so dominant in the octagon – specifically his relentless pressure and ability to impose his will on opponents. The guest (likely a training partner) explains that Khabib's approach involves creating constant pressure, forcing scrambles, and putting opponents in positions where they can't escape. This methodical, grinding style wears opponents down both physically and mentally, leaving them with no escape and no way to reset.</p>

<p>The conversation delves deep into the mental aspect of fighting, with the guest emphasizing that Khabib never lets up – he doesn't give opponents the satisfaction of a tap out or a moment of relief. They reference legendary wrestler Dan Gable, who famously pushed himself in practice until he quit – but never actually reached that point. This mentality of relentless improvement and refusal to stop is what both fighters credit for their success. The guest also describes Khabib's intense training camp in Dubai, where he trains twice daily with 25 high-level training partners, often doing 1.5-hour non-stop sessions cycling through multiple opponents.</p>

<p>The discussion also touches on the physical reality of sparring with Khabib, describing an experience of grappling with a large opponent who felt like 280 pounds – comparing it to the experience of playing one-on-one basketball against Michael Jordan at the YMCA. The guest expresses deep love for the sport, noting that even when traveling and unable to train properly, he feels off and misses the grind. This passion, combined with the grueling training methodology, provides insight into what makes Khabib's style so effective and his dominance so complete.</p>
