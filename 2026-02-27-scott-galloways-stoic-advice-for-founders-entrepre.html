      <h1>Scott Galloway's Stoic Advice for Founders & Entrepreneurs | My First Million</h1>

<p>In this episode, marketing professor and entrepreneur Scott Galloway shares his perspective on stoicism and how it applies to building businesses and living a fulfilling life. He explains that while many people are familiar with stoicism, they often struggle to understand how it practically applies to daily life. Galloway breaks it down simply: life isn't about what happens to you—you can't control external events—but you can control how you respond to them. He references Ryan Holiday as his "Yoda" on stoicism and shares a memorable modern interpretation from *Brokeback Mountain*: "If you can't fix it, you gotta stand it." This mindset helps entrepreneurs focus their energy on what they can actually change rather than wasting energy on uncontrollable circumstances.</p>

<p>Galloway gets candid about his own struggles with social media, particularly Twitter. He admits he spent years being emotionally affected by online criticism and negativity, even though he intellectually knew it shouldn't matter. Eventually, he took action reminiscent of Sam Harris—fellow thinker who also left Twitter—and has been off the platform for nine months. He describes this as one of the most beneficial things for his mental health, noting that several of his worst weekends were triggered by things he saw on Twitter. He expresses particular concern about social media's impact on teenagers, especially girls, warning that algorithms can quickly spiral users toward harmful content like extreme dieting or content normalizing depression and suicide.</p>

<p>The conversation takes a profound turn when Galloway discusses mortality and regret. He shares research from his NYU colleague Adam Alter, who studied people near the end of their lives in palliative care. The biggest regret? That people wished they'd been less hard on themselves—they wished they'd forgiven themselves and allowed themselves to be happy. Galloway emphasizes that what truly matters isn't what Twitter thinks of you, but rather your relationship with your spouse and whether your kids are happy. His final takeaway is pragmatic yet compassionate: you'll be dead soon, so stop beating yourself up and squeeze as much joy from life as possible while being kind to yourself along the way.</p>

<h2>Key Topics Discussed</h2>

<li>Core stoic philosophy: controlling your response to events, not the events themselves</li>
<li>Social media's negative impact on mental health and the benefits of taking breaks</li>
<li>Mortality and perspective—what matters at the end of life</li>
<li>Self-forgiveness and self-compassion</li>
<li>The importance of personal relationships over external validation</li>

<p>---</p>

<h2>Main Takeaways</h2>

<p>• <strong>Focus on what you can control.</strong> You can't control what happens to you, but you can control your emotional response. Channel energy toward problems you can actually solve.</p>

<p>• <strong>Social media isn't worth your mental health.</strong> Galloway found that stepping away from Twitter significantly improved his wellbeing—if something is making you regularly upset, consider removing it from your life.</p>

<p>• <strong>Most external validation is meaningless.</strong> In 100 years, nothing you did or what others thought of you will matter. Focus on what actually lasts: relationships with your spouse and children.</p>

<p>• <strong>Be kinder to yourself.</strong> Research shows the biggest regret of dying people is that they wished they'd been less hard on themselves. Practice self-forgiveness and allow yourself to be happy.</p>

<p>• <strong>Your emotions aren't always logical.</strong> When you're feeling down, recognize it may be chemistry rather than legitimate reason—this awareness helps you navigate low moments more effectively.</p>

<p>---</p>
