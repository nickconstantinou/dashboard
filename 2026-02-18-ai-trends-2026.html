So here's the thing about AI in 2026 — it's not about the robots taking over anymore. According to the latest from Microsoft and IBM, this year AI becomes something far more mundane and useful: your work colleague.

Microsoft reckons we're about to see seven big trends this year, all focused on making AI a "true partner" rather than some flashy future tech. Think teamwork, security, and actually getting stuff done in research. Not quite as sexy as HAL 9000, but infinitely more useful.

The US government is already on board — nearly 90% of federal agencies are using or planning to use AI. That's a proper institutional stamp of approval, whether you're into it or not.

Over at Stanford, the experts are saying something interesting: don't expect AGI this year (sorry, sci-fi fans), but AI sovereignty is going to be huge. Basically, countries are going to want their own AI infrastructure rather than relying on American tech companies. Smart move, arguably.

MIT Sloan has been digging into the data too, and they're seeing AI shift from being this experimental thing companies try to something that actually lives in the organisation. Like how every business eventually got email, every business is going to have AI embedded in it somehow.

The interesting question is what happens next. If AI becomes infrastructure — boring, essential, everywhere — does that mean the hype dies down? Probably. But that might actually be the point. When something becomes truly useful, it stops being exciting and just becomes part of the furniture.

Anyway, interested to see how this plays out. If you're building anything in AI this year, the money seems to be moving toward practical applications rather than moonshots. The gold rush is over; now it's about building the mines.
