The PACs will back politicians who are friendly to AI and push back against legislation that could limit the growth of Meta's AI business.

OpenAI has hired Charles Porch, who helped land Instagram's biggest partnerships — including the launch of Beyoncé's self-titled album on the social network — as its first VP of global creative partnerships.

"I’m going to be the person that’s talking to creative communities around the world to figure out how we build the best products to serve them," Porch tells Vanity Fair.

### Epic Games Acquires Meshcapade for AI Animation Tech

With the acquisition, Epic says it's "looking forward to working together to advance digital human technologies for use across gaming, film and entertainment."
