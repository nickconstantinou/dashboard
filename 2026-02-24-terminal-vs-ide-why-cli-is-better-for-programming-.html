      <h1>Terminal vs IDE: Why CLI is Better for Programming with AI</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this discussion, Peter Steinberger shares his journey transitioning from traditional IDEs to a terminal-first workflow enhanced by AI coding assistants. He recounts starting with Cloud Code around April and finding it refreshing compared to conventional development environments, though he still relied heavily on his IDE initially because the AI tools weren't quite good enough yet.</p>

<p>After experimenting with Cursor, Peter found it compelling but frustrating because of difficulties managing multiple versions simultaneously. He eventually returned to Cloud Code as his primary tool, which improved over time. At one point, he was burning through approximately seven subscriptions daily because he became so comfortable running multiple windows side by side—all CLI-based, all terminal-driven.</p>

<p>When asked how much he was using traditional IDEs at that point, Peter admitted he used them "very, very rarely," primarily just as a diff viewer. He explains that he became increasingly comfortable with the reality that he doesn't need to read every line of code. He notably shares that he has a blog post declaring "I don't read the code," clarifying that he means he skips the boring parts—the routine data transformation logic that makes up much of software.</p>

<p>Peter's philosophical take is that most software fundamentally just moves data from one shape to another: data comes in, gets stored in a database, gets retrieved, shown to users, processed by browsers or native apps, and then reverses the process. He emphasizes that these mechanical transformations aren't exciting to read through, nor does he need to examine every CSS class like how a button is aligned in Tailwind.</p>

<h2>Key Topics Discussed</h2>

<li>Personal evolution with AI coding tools (Cloud Code, Cursor)</li>
<li>Transition from IDE-heavy workflows to terminal-first approaches</li>
<li>Managing multiple AI assistant windows/sessions</li>
<li>Philosophy on code reading and what deserves attention</li>
<li>The nature of most software as "data transformation"</li>

<h2>Main Takeaways</h2>

<li><strong>AI assistants have reached a tipping point</strong> where terminal-based workflows can replace much of traditional IDE functionality, though the transition takes adjustment</li>
<li><strong>Multiple simultaneous AI sessions</strong> can dramatically increase productivity, but managing subscriptions and versions can become chaotic</li>
<li><strong>Terminal-only workflows are viable</strong> for experienced developers who understand their codebase well enough to trust AI handles routine tasks</li>
<li><strong>Reading every line of code isn't necessary</strong> — focusing on high-level architecture and interesting logic is more valuable than getting lost in boilerplate</li>
<li><strong>Most software is unglamorous data shuffling</strong> — understanding this helps developers prioritize what to examine versus delegate to AI</li>

<h2>Who Would Benefit from Watching</h2>

<p>Developers curious about optimizing their workflow with AI assistants, those considering moving away from heavy IDEs, and programmers interested in the philosophy of what deserves human attention versus AI delegation. Tech leads evaluating AI coding tools for their teams would also find value in understanding practical real-world usage patterns.</p>
