## Today's AI Headlines

Here's what's happening in the AI world today:

### Anthropic Releases Claude Sonnet 4.6

Anthropic just launched the latest version of Claude Sonnet, which they say "approaches Opus-level intelligence." The update brings improvements in coding and computer use — things like navigating spreadsheets or filling out web forms. Sonnet 4.6 is now the default model for both free and pro Claude users, replacing Sonnet 4.5.

### Meta Plans to Spend $65M on Elections to Sway AI Legislation

Meta is apparently throwing money at the political process to shape AI regulation in their favour. The funding goes toward pro-AI super PACs — including "Forge the Future Project" (Republican-focused) and "Making Our Tomorrow" (Democrat-focused). The goal? Back politicians who are friendly to AI and push back against legislation that could limit Meta's AI business.

### Netflix Gives ByteDance Three Days to Stop Seedance AI Theft

Netflix is threatening immediate litigation against ByteDance (TikTok's parent) over what they call "Seedance AI theft." The streaming giant claims Seedance is generating unauthorized derivative works using Netflix's intellectual property — Stranger Things, KPop Demon Hunters, Squid Game, and Bridgerton. They've given ByteDance three days to stop, or it's court time.

### xAI Faces Legal Battle Over Data Center Pollution

The NAACP is threatening to sue xAI over unpermitted gas turbines in Mississippi powering the Colossus 2 data center. Environmental groups have been drilling into this — thermal drone images show more than a dozen turbines running without a permit. Another headache for Musk's AI venture.

### Epic Games Acquires Meshcapade for Digital Humans

Epic is buying Meshcapade, a company that makes AI tech for animating digital humans. The team will join Epic's AI Research team and work on technologies for Unreal Engine and those hyperrealistic MetaHumans. More fuel for the digital human revolution.
