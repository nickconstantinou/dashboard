      <h1>Scott Galloway's Stoic Advice for Founders & Entrepreneurs | My First Million</h1>

<p>In this episode, marketing professor and entrepreneur Scott Galloway shares his perspective on stoicism and how it applies to entrepreneurship and life. He explains that stoicism isn't about suppressing emotions, but rather about focusing on what you can control—your responses to events—rather than what you can't control. Referencing Ryan Holiday (his "Yoda on stoicism"), Galloway emphasizes that life isn't about what happens to you, but how you respond to what happens to you. He uses the iconic film *Brokeback Mountain* as a modern metaphor: "If you can't fix it, you got to stand it."</p>

<p>Galloway gets personal about his struggles with social media, particularly Twitter. He admits that despite knowing intellectually that Twitter criticism doesn't matter, he couldn't separate himself emotionally from it. He describes how he spent years being "bummed out" by things that started on the platform, eventually leading him to quit Twitter entirely for nine months—a decision he calls "one of the most creative things to my mental health." He also expresses concern about social media's impact on teenagers, particularly young girls, warning about algorithmic rabbit holes that can lead to harmful content.</p>

<p>The conversation takes a deeper turn as Galloway discusses mortality and regret. He references research by his NYU colleague Adam Alter on people near death, revealing that the biggest regret isn't about career or achievements—it's about being too hard on oneself. This realization has led Galloway to focus on self-forgiveness and allowing himself to be happy. He encourages listeners to squeeze as much joy out of life as possible, recognizing that everyone will be dead soon and that what social media thinks of you doesn't truly matter.</p>

<h2>Key Topics Discussed</h2>

<li>Practical stoicism: controlling your responses rather than external events</li>
<li>The negative mental health impact of social media platforms</li>

<li>What truly matters: close relationships with spouse and children</li>

<p>---</p>

<h2>Main Takeaways</h2>

<li><strong>Focus on what you can control.</strong> You can't control what happens to you, but you can control how you respond emotionally. This is the core of stoic philosophy.</li>

<li><strong>Social media isn't worth your mental health.</strong> Galloway quit Twitter for nine months and noticed significant improvements in his wellbeing. If a platform regularly upsets you, consider stepping away.</li>

<li><strong>Most people aren't thinking about you as much as you think.</strong> The embarrassing moments you replay in your head? Others have likely forgotten them entirely. Focus on what your immediate family thinks of you rather than public opinion.</li>

<li><strong>You'll regret being too hard on yourself.</strong> Research on the dying shows self-forgiveness and allowing yourself to be happy are the biggest regrets. Stop beating yourself up.</li>

<li><strong>Life is short—live for yourself.</strong> Don't live the life society or parents wanted. Focus on close relationships and extracting joy from life rather than external validation.</li>
